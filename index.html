            An idea of developing an application, for health-related issues faced by the user. 
            The lack of accessible and accurate healthcare information often leads to 
            confusion and delayed medical care, potentially exacerbating health issues. 
            Many individuals face difficulties in identifying the appropriate steps 
            to take when they experience symptoms of illness. Moreover, finding trusted 
            doctors and  healthcare facilities nearby can be daunting, especially for those 
            unfamiliar with the healthcare landscape or residing in new areas.
